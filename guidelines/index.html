					<h2>Commission process</h2>
					<p>1. You can claim a commission by reacting to a commission message in <span class="colored">#commissions</span> with the ✅ (yes) emoji.</p>
					<p>2. Once you claim the commission, head over to the ticket channel you just got added to. All tickets appear at the top of the discord server.</p>
					<p>3. Next, discuss the commission details and the price with the client.</p>
					<p>4. If you <b>are not</b> able to finish or make the requested product please tag <span class="colored">@Management</span>. In that case you will be removed from the ticket and the commission will be reposted. If you <b>are</b> able to fulfill the reqest the ticket will be marked as <span class="colored">Active</span> by management.</p>
					<p>5. Before you start work, the client has to pay the first 50% of the full price. You can either tag <span class="colored">@Management</span> or execute the command <code>-pay <50% of the price></code> In most cases management will execute it for you and after we confirm the payment and give you the green light the ticket will be marked as <span class="colored">Half</span> by management.</p>
					<p>6. You can now start work on the project, make sure to give the client frequent updates on your progress. <i>Make sure to watermark any previews.</i></p>
					<p>7. If the client <b>does not</b> like the previews of the product you made, he may request a refund. In that case please tag <span class="colored">@Management</span> and we will handle the situation from there. If the client <b>does</b> like the final product you can either tag <span class="colored">@Management</span> or execute the command <code>-pay <50% of the price></code> and after we confirm the payment and give you the green light the ticket will be marked as <span class="colored">Paid</span> by management and you will send the final unwatermarked product to the client.</p>
					<p>8. After the client recieves your product the ticket will be marked as <span class="colored">Completed</span>. You are allowed to ask for a vouch on any platform that you and the client might share.</p>
					<p>9. After the ticket is marked as <span class="colored">Completed</span> and we confirm we got all of the money, you will be paid your cut as soon as possible.</p>
